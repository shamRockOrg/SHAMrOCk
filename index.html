            <p><H4>The aim of the SHAMrOCk project is to create a simple, general-purpose control system, initially used to control a Sphero spherical robot using the LeapMotion hands-free controller system.</H4></p>

            <p>We tried to use the various android applications available. Some work and the ball responds to the inputs as expected (regardless of our driving skills)</p>
            <p>But the RGB led does not seem to work at all.</p>

                </a>Initial problems</h3>

            <p>The connection with Sphero isn't stable neither on linux nor on windows. For Linux the bluetooth stack and the python biding might not be complete but on windows it should work.</p>
            <p>The main problem is that we cannot get anything from the ball, we can send a command but we get no response, ever.</p>

            <p>We will check the java project from the last group who used the Sphero to see if it still working and if the java driver work better than the python/ruby one.</p>

            <p>Kåre orders a Sphero V2 which, according to the documentation, is better than V1 when it cme to sdk and connection.</p>

            <p>
                First of all, we calc an average position of our hand when we were using LeapMotion so the control would be smoother.
                Every 5 frames we get the average value of our hands position.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then, we focused on the "non-official" Sphero driver in order to receive data; We had to modified to non blocking.
                Because it used to block when we receive the first message. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thank Python! We imported Sphero libraries to the LeapMotion controller, we wrote some commands for connecting, and 'voila', we can controll Sphero from LeapMotion.
                Now, we have to improve the control to make it more intuitive and smoother.
            </p>

                </a>Current status of the project</h3>
            
            <p>
                Pervasive Computing has finished and we are happy what we have achieved.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can control sphero with our hand through LeapMotion. The ball has 360º of movement, how do we do that?
First of all, we calculate a start point of our hand, 
then we are able to measure a direction and speed from our hand next position every frame getting the angle and length
of the vector. Finally, we send the right command.</p>
            <p>

The color of sphero will change depending on the speed.
</p>
            <p>
As we have gesture recognition in LeapMotion, when we roll our finger and sphero is stopped we modify the header so it points us.
</p>
            <p>Finally, we can control both versions although V2 is smoother.
